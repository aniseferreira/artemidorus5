# Artemidorus' Book 5
## Collection of Ancient Greek annotated trees and aligned translations of Artemidorus' Oneirocritica Book 5
- The trees were annotated manually on Perseids Platform using Arethusa tool. The treebank tagset and guidelines used were those from [The Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank ](https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data/blob/master/AGDT2/guidelines/Greek_guidelines.md) with the morphological and syntactic layer, which was based on Bamman's and Crane's 2008 *Guidelines for the Syntactic Annotation of the
Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank (1.1)*, and its translationi nto Portuguese with a few addition of some specifications provided by a forum maintained during a Tufts'project. The Artemidorus' book 5 trees can be visualized at Perseids collection at https://perseids-publications.github.io/unesp-trees
- The translations were aligned on Ugarit platform, and can be visualized at http://ugarit.ialigner.com/userProfile.php?userid=15&tgid=9056  The Greek text source was the digitized Pack's 1963 edition from CTS Perseids:  urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0553.tlg001.1st1K-grc1:5 And the Portuguese source is the reviewed translation by me of a previous one published by Cultura AcadÃªmica as an ebook (https://www.culturaacademica.com.br/catalogo/oneirokritika-de-artemidoro-de-daldis-seculo-ii-d-c/).
