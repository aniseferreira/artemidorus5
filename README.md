# Artemidorus' Book 5
 
## Collection of Ancient Greek annotated trees and aligned translations of Artemidorus' Oneirocritica Book 5
The trees were annotated manually on Perseids Platform using the Arethusa tool. The selected tagset was [The Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank ](https://github.com/PerseusDL/treebank_data/blob/master/AGDT2/guidelines/Greek_guidelines.md), with the morphological and syntactic layer, based on Bamman's and Crane's 2008 *Guidelines for the Syntactic Annotation of the Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank (1.1)*. We translated it into Portuguese with a few additions from some specifications provided by a forum maintained in 2013 by Alpheios.net, [which is no longer online](https://web.archive.org/web/20160401072609/http://treebank.alpheios.net/book). The trees are available in Perseids Collection as UNESP-trees at https://perseids-publications.github.io/unesp-trees.
- The translations were aligned on the Ugarit Platform and are visible at http://ugarit.ialigner.com/userProfile.php?userid=15&tgid=9056. The Greek text source was the digitized Pack's 1963 edition from CTS Perseids: urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0553.tlg001.1st1K-grc1:5. And the Portuguese text is the revised translation by me of a previous one published by Cultura AcadÃªmica as an [ebook](https://www.culturaacademica.com.br/catalogo/oneirokritika-de-artemidoro-de-daldis-seculo-ii-d-c/) in 2015.
- The alignment guidelines for Portuguese achieved 88% according to Tariq Yousef's agreement analysis of the dataset (see LREC22 paper)
- Tips clarifying the annotation of potentially troublesome sentences are available at https://github.com/aniseferreira/LetrasClassicasDigitais/blob/master/exemplos-anotacao-arvores.md.
